# EFP-Twitter-tapp
EFP Twitter Tapp idea. It's a Tapp that allows users to follow other users on the EFP (Ethereum Name Service Follow Protocol) system using Basenames NFTs. The main functionalities include:
Following a Basename owner
Generating a TLink for sharing
The Tapp is designed to work with three main contracts:
EFPListNFT
ENSlistRecords
Basenames
The TokenScript file (EFPTwitterTapp.xml) defines the structure and functionality of this Tapp. It includes two main cards:
A "follow" card for following other users
A "generateTLink" card for creating shareable TLinks
The Tapp leverages existing tokens/NFTs (Basenames) and doesn't require additional services or products beyond what's defined in the TokenScript file. This aligns with the requirements for creating Tapps that can be easily shared and used on platforms like Twitter.
